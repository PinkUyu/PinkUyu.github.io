## My Project <img width="250" height="250" align="right" src="/assets/IMG/new_mine.png">

I applied machine learning techniques to investigate mine detection and mine type classification.

## Introduction 

For both post- and active battle landmarks, minefields remain a problem for the soldiers and civilians present in the area. Landmines are used as a deterrent for both infantry and vehicles, and therefore mine detection remains an important feat for military efforts. However, in regions that were previously war-torn, minefields are still leftover once civilians begin to reoccupy the area. This often leads to the deaths of innocent people who wander out, and so the  majority of mine detection efforts are utilized to make these areas livable without danger again.

Several methods are currently used for detection. A more recent and unique application to the problem is the usage of rats to find landmines. Due to their lightweight, high mobility, and sensitive smell, they can be trained to identify likely spots for which landmines have been buried. Specialized vehicles that resist high explosive blasts can also be driven over fields to activate the mines, but this form of disarmament leads to disruption of the surrounding land and still poses some risks, especially when dealing with the stronger landmines. In terms of manual removal, there are two main employed features of detection: active and passive. In active detection, a sensor sends a signal into the ground, and receives a signal back from the mine. This form of detection often leads to the detonation of mines since the signal sent out triggers their explosives, which inherently poses a risk to the land and operators. In passive detection, a sensor simply receives signals from landmines. Although this avoids the issue of activation, this type of detection is not as effective. In mine discovery, extremely high accurracies are necessary as mistakes can lead to cost lives.

[This dataset](./assets/Mine_Dataset.csv) consists of voltage caused by distortion from the mine, height of the sensor to the ground, and the soil type around the buried mine (Figure 1). The mine types encountered at these respective conditions has been tabulated. This allows for a supervised, classification machine learning approach. Since the dataset is labelled and we know what correlates based on the input, the choice of method should be supervised. Since the output is one of five choices, the choice of methods should be a classification. Given the dataset's size of 338 instances, approaches such as decision trees, support vector classification, and ensemble methods are most appropriate.

The employment of these methods attempts to provide a model that can accurately predict both the presence of, and type, of mine. Therefore, compounded by field knowledge or the usage of other assisted methods, passive detection can be improved which avoids landmine detonation.

## Data

The dataset was retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and was originally sourced in the study "Passive Mine Detection and Classification Method Based on Hybrid Model" by Cemal Yilmaz, Hamdi Tolga Kahraman, and Salih SÃ¶yler.[1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443331). Figure 2 shows the distribution of mine types within the data. The dataset is almost perfectly balanced between the mine types, with only a 9% difference (6 samples) between the most and least populated types. The data has also come pre-normalized, such that all values of voltage, height, and soil type exist as values between 0 and 1 inclusive.

## Modelling

Given the nature of the problem set, machine learning models such as decision trees and support vectors are the most appropriate. In general, these can be improved with the K-Nearest Neighbors or various ensemble methods as well. In this report, these models were utilized as well as comparisons to other models that would normally be deemed non-classical for this dataset, such as a neural network.

The separation and processing of the data for modelling is as follows:

```python
X_data=mines.drop(['M'],axis=1).values #columns except for M
Y_data=mines['M'].values #M column
Y_data = Y_data.reshape(-1,1)

Y_binary_data = (Y_data >= 2).astype(int)

#split data into training and testing
test_size = 0.1
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test, Y_binary_train, Y_binary_test = train_test_split(X_data, Y_data, Y_binary_data, test_size=test_size, random_state=3)
```
The X_data stores the V, H, and S categories, Y_data stores values from 1-5 depending on the mine type, and Y_binary_data converts Y_data into 0 or 1 depending on the absence of (0) or presense of (1) a landmine.

The general format utilized for each machine learning model for fitting the data is as follows:

```python
single_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=max_depth)
single_tree.fit(X_train, Y_train)

Y_pred_single = single_tree.predict(X_test).reshape(-1, 1)

print("Single Tree")
print(single_tree.feature_importances_)
single_acc = accuracy_score(Y_test, Y_pred_single)
single_score = single_tree.score(X_data, Y_data)
print(single_acc)
print(single_score)
ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(Y_test, Y_pred_single)
plt.show()
```

In the above implementation, a decision tree model is fit to the training data. The predicted values are then produced from the model. For the models that have the appropriate attributes, the feature importances were retrieved. Additionally, for each model, the accuracy with respect to the test data was calculated. In order to test the generalization of each model, the accuracy of the model against the entire dataset was also calculated. These accuracies were then represented via a confusion matrix.
